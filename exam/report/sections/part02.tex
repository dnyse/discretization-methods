\section{Solving Burger's Equation using Fourier Collocation}
The Fourier Collocation method was implemented using odd-numbered grid points defined as:
\begin{equation}
	x_j = \frac{2\pi}{N+1}j, \quad j \in [0, N]
\end{equation}
The Spatial derivatives were computed using the Fourier differentiation matrix $\tilde{D}$, and time integration was performed using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta scheme.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{align}
		u_1     & = u^n + \frac{\Delta t}{2}F(u^n)                                             \\
		u_2     & = u^n + \frac{\Delta t}{2}F(u_1)                                             \\
		u_3     & = u^n + \Delta t F(u_2)                                                      \\
		u^{n+1} & = \frac{1}{3}\left[-u^n + u_1 + 2u_2 + u_3 + \frac{\Delta t}{2}F(u_3)\right]
	\end{align}
	\label{eq:rk4_burgers}
\end{equation}
where $F(u^n) = -u^n\frac{\partial u^n}{\partial x} + \nu\frac{\partial^2 u^n}{\partial x^2}$.\newline
The time step was determined according to the following CFL condition
\begin{equation}
	\Delta t \leq \text{CFL} \times \left[\max_{x_j} \left(\frac{|u(x_j)|}{\Delta x} + \frac{\nu}{(\Delta x)^2}\right) \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Determining Maximum CFL Values}

\subsubsection{Methodology}
The maximum CFL values, which were stable (The interpretation of what is stable in my case see below) were determined by an incremental testing approach that explores the stability boundary for each grid size. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Incremental Testing}: For each grid size $N$, CFL values are tested incrementally starting from 0.05 with steps of 0.05
	\item \textbf{Stability Criterion}: A solution is considered stable if:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item No NaN or infinite values occur during time integration
		      \item The error change between consecutive CFL values satisfies: $|\text{error}_{\text{current}} - \text{error}_{\text{previous}}| < 0.25$
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Termination}: Testing stops when the stability criterion is violated.
	\item \textbf{Safety Selection}: The last stable CFL value is selected as the maximum.
\end{enumerate}
%
This methodology is based on the results than can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:error_fc}.It detects the transition from stable to unstable numerical behavior through the characteristic sharp increase in $L_\infty$ error.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		$N$ & Max CFL \\
		\hline
		16  & 1.4000  \\
		32  & 1.2500  \\
		48  & 1.1500  \\
		64  & 1.0000  \\
		96  & 0.9500  \\
		128 & 0.9000  \\
		192 & 0.7500  \\
		256 & 0.6500  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Maximum stable CFL values for different grid sizes}
	\label{tab:cfl}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Analysis of CFL Results}
The maximum CFL values show a clear trend, where they decrease with increasing grid resolution, which is to be expected and be explained through the following CFL stability condition:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Grid Refinement Effect}: As $N$ increases, $\Delta x = \frac{2\pi}{N+1}$ decreases proportionally
	\item \textbf{Diffusion Dominance}: For fine grids, the diffusion constraint $\frac{\nu}{(\Delta x)^2}$ becomes dominant, scaling as $\frac{1}{(\Delta x)^2}$
	\item \textbf{Stability Restriction}: This quadratic dependence on the grid spacing results in the time step constraint increasingly restrictive for finer grids.
\end{itemize}
%
The observed CFL values are higher than the usual limit seen for pure diffusion problems. This is because Burgers' equation combines both advection and diffusion effects, with the advection term allowing for larger stable time steps, especially on coarser grids.

\subsection{Convergence Study}

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		$N$ & CFL    & $L_\infty$ Error & CPU Time \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Convergence study results for different grid sizes at $t = \pi/4$}
	\label{tab:convergence}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		$N$ & Rate \\
		\hline
		32  & 1.53 \\
		48  & 2.10 \\
		64  & 6.30 \\
		96  & 4.99 \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Convergence rates between successive grid refinements}
	\label{tab:rates}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Convergence Analysis}
The convergence study shows spectral convergence, which is the expected results for Fourier spectral methods applied to smooth, periodic functions:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{High-Order Rates}: Convergence rates usually exceed 2, with most values ranging from 6 to 8, showing higher convergence rate than any fixed polynomial order
	\item \textbf{Rate Variability}: The variation in convergence rates is characteristic of the transition between different accuracy regimes in spectral methods.
	\item \textbf{Physical Validation}: The high convergence rates show that the Burgers' solution remains smooth and well-resolved at $t = \pi/4$
\end{itemize}
%
The observed behavior clearly demonstrates that the Fourier Collocation method is exploiting the smoothness of the solution.
\subsection{Time Evolution Study}
\begin{table}[H]

		0.5236 & 6.480862e-04     & 0.0421s  \\
		0.7854 & 2.522970e-04     & 0.0651s  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Time evolution for N = 128 with $\nu = 0.10$ and CFL = 0.90}
	\label{tab:time_evolution}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Error Evolution Analysis}
The time evolution study reveals a counter-intuitive but physically correct phenomenon, namely the numerical error decreases over time from $t = \pi/8$ to $t = \pi/4$. This behavior can be explained through the physics of the viscous Burgers' equation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Viscous Smoothing}: The diffusion term $\nu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$ acts as a smoothing mechanism, gradually reducing sharp gradients in the solution
	\item \textbf{Initial Complexity}: At ($t = \pi/8$) the solution may contain steeper gradients or transitional features that are more challenging to resolve numerically
	\item \textbf{Fourier Advantage}: As the solution becomes smoother due to the viscous effects, it is better represented by the truncated Fourier series, leading to reduced errors.
\end{itemize}
%
This error behavior is validating both the physical correctness of the numerical solution. Furthermore it shows the effectiveness of the Fourier spectral method for capturing the fascinating dynamics of the Burgers' equation.

\subsection{Solution Visualization}
The results in Figure~\ref{fig:figureLabel} from the Fourier Collocation  implementation are physically consistent and numerically sound:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Stability Analysis}: The methodology to find the max CFL successfully identifies stability boundaries through error spike detection.
	\item \textbf{Convergence Validation}: Spectral convergence rates show optimal performance for smooth, periodic solutions.
	\item \textbf{Physical Accuracy}: The decreasing error trend and solution visualization validate the physical correctness of the implementation.
	\item \textbf{Method Effectiveness}: The combination of Fourier spectral spatial discretization with 4th-order Runge-Kutta time integration provides both high accuracy and computational efficiency
\end{itemize}
